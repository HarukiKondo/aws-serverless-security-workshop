# Serverless Security Workshop


> **WARNING**: The purpose of the workshop is to provide a starter API which **does NOT follow many security best practices** on purpose. The tutorial modules guide you to identify security gaps in the starter app, and implement protection measures for them.  
>
> Furthermore, the modules **do not cover ALL** the security measures that should be applied. After completing all modules, we recommend you to explore additional protections, such as ensuring the principle of least privilege. See the **Extra Credit** section for more details.
